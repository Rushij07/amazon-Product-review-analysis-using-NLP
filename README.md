### Objectives
- To perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews and movie reviews.
- To implement NLP techniques for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and text classification.
- To predict the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and star ratings of reviews.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NLTK, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (or any other libraries used)

## Features
- Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning text data, tokenization, removing stop words, stemming/lemmatization.
- Sentiment Analysis**: Classifying reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
- Rating Prediction**: Predicting the star ratings of reviews using machine learning models.
